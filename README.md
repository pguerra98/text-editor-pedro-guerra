# text-editor-pedro-guerra

## Description

In this bootcamp challenge, the task is to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be single-page and will meet the PWA criteria. This app will
also feature numerous data persistence techniques that serve as redudancy in case of the options not being supported by the browser. Also, the app will be fully
functional even if the user is offline.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This challenged allowed me to improve my JavaScript & PWA coding skills. This challenge gave us a starter code, so overall it was not terribly difficult, but
understanding the general idea took some time, and it was a rewarding challenge for sure.
